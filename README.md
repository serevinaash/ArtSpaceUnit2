# ArtSpace
Sample project from "Android Basics with Compose" course. #AndroidBasics
I used Glide for image loading to get images from my artstation. 
I used database and Room to have list of names and urls of artworks.
Pretty simple design buttons "Next" and "Previous" go through the list of artworks and load respective title, author, year and image url.
